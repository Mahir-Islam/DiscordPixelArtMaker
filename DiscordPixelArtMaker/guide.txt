This program allows you to take advantage of the
coloured square emojis on Discord to make pixel art.

You will need to have the following installed:
> pygame
> pyperclip

Open main.py to run the application and
you will see a 12x12 grid.

Clicking on a colour will change the brush to that colour.
Clicking on "COPY" will save the image onto your clipboard.
Clicking on "CLEAR" will reset the canvas.

If you want to change the size of the grid, then open main.py
and on line 15, change the value of "ROWS" to whatever you like.
Be aware that Discord may not be able to
properly display very large messages.
